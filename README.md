# Real Estsate Finder

Welcome to the Real Estate Scraper project! This application scrapes data from real estate websites like Remax and Zolo, processes the data, and provides users with various search functionalities to explore property listings. I have used Selenium to scrap the required data from Remax and Zolo websites.

- **Explore Properties by Province**: Search and display property listings by province.
- **Discover Homes by City**: Search and display property listings by city.
- **Find Properties Within Budget**: Filter listings based on your budget.
- **Search Cozy Homes by Bedrooms and Bathrooms**: Filter listings based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
